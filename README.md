# SDL Hot Reload

This repository provides me with an environment to research hot reloading C/C++ code by using useful APIs from the
open-source [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) library. Currently, I was able to make it work in Windows by
using [MSBuild](https://github.com/dotnet/msbuild). However, it should be easy to
port it to other platforms considering SDL APIs are cross-platform.
